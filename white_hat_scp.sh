# this line secure copied the file from the shell server onto my virtual machine into a directory called "ethics" as required by the challenge, the file was hidden so I used the recursive option to find it
python3 -m http.server 80 -bind 127.0.0.1
# from the ethics directory I ran this python module to serve up all the files from that directory on a simple web server at the required IP address and port
# I then ran the binary that searches for the file at the desired URL and produces a flag when it finds it.
